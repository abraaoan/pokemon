# Pokemon Challenge
Swift mvvm(not reactive) with PokeApi

# The Challenge
1. The main screen will then need to present with the Pokemon name and image. You may use any layout.
2. is redirected to a detail screen explained on step 3
3. The user should see a list of a minimum of six descriptions with info plus your image.
You may use any layout.

# A little about planning
- First I read the API Docs in https://pokeapi.co
- Next I find a router that works for my ideas: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/?limit=20&offset=20
- After that I explore how it's works and start think how made a App with it.
- So I open my old by gold Sketch(v.48) and made some Ideas:

- Now I have all I needed to start coding.

# Design Pattern
- The idea it's use MVVM but without reactive programing.
- Beside that I used SOLID principle
- I used too Singleton
- And others

# Tests
- The main Ideia it's to used MVVM to make some unit test.
- But I was not able to finish all View Model in time.
- I just abe to made UITests

# Final toughts
- Was able to put my knowloge in pratice, and had a lot of fun.
- There are a lot of skill that I want to show, but create a app from nothing without proposal(final people won't use) it's not easy.
- That's All, Thanks
